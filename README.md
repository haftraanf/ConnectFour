# ConnectFour
This game was created using Java and object-oriented programming principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Not only did I have to implement a human player, but I was also required to implement an AI player. The AI player is designed to both defend against potential wins by the human player and make strategic moves to try and win the game. We implemented the decision-making process for the AI player using a combination of logical statements and randomization. This allowed the AI player to make smart and unpredictable moves during gameplay.
##Going the Extra Mile for a Better User Experience
Implementing Connect Four was an assignment in one of my COMPSCI courses in my second year of university, and even though we weren't specifically asked to add GUI components, I took the initiative to go beyond the requirements. I felt that playing the game on the console was not enjoyable, so I wanted to improve the usability for a better user experience, so that players can easily interact with the game and visually see the game board, making it more engaging and intuitive. I believe it adds a professional touch to the overall presentation of the game.
##Future imporovements
Although the previous version of the game included an AI player, integrating it into the GUI turned out to be quite challenging. As a result, my next step will be to focus on adding the AI player functionality to enhance the overall gameplay experience.
